# Visual Studio Project Folder
This directory is pre-configured for the visual studio environment. Don't touch anything here, unless you are using visual studio. If you are not using visual studio, you can directly edit the files used in the project solution in the FinalProject subdirectory.
#Git Ignore Notice
Some debugging and like files are created when you open the solution, build, or debug. These files are selected to be IGNORED by git, so they are not included when making a commit. That is intentional, as they are NOT required to use the solution.
