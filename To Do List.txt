To Do:

-BEFORE SUBMIT-
*Make sure the correct #includes are in the correct files

Output File
- Create it //RW Use constructor with ostream parameter and it should write whatever VendingMachine outputs
- Send the current console output (cout) to the file instead //RW (only for VendingMachine)
- Also, make sure to send the simulated input to the output file, so it makes sense

FinalProject.cpp
- Configure inputMachine() to work with any dimension of machine //Finished?
- Have the output function actually make a console output file //Finished?
- Have the input function actually interact with the vending machine

VendingMachine.cpp
- Should not call cout. Replace cout with ostream parameter that main sends cout as an argument. //RW
- Split Letters from Numbers 
- Add Timeout function
- Add Clear Button function (a manual timeout button)
- Complete the logic of each transition

VM001-Command-Input.txt
- Make it work with the program or make the program work with it //Finished?

If we finish early
- Add different prices for the items
