To Do:

Output File
- Create it
- Send the current console output (cout) to the file instead
- Also, make sure to send the simulated input to the output file, so it makes sense

FinalProject.cpp
- Configure inputMachine() to work with any dimension of machine
- Have the output function actually make an console output file
- Have the input function actually interact with the vending machine

VendingMachine.cpp
- Should not call cout. Replace cout with ostream parameter that main sends cout as an argument.
- Split Letters from Numbers 
- Add Timeout function
- Add Clear Button function (a manual timeout button)
- CheckCard should interact with a bank class
- Complete the logic of each transition

VM001-Command-Input.txt
- Make it work with the program or make the program work with it

CreditCard.h and .cpp
- Change so it only has credit card number, if we want *and modulus 2*

If we finish early
- Add different prices for the items
