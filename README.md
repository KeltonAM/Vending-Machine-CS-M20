# Instructions for Use:
This project has now been configured to manualy work with visual studio.

Simply download the Github for Desktop https://desktop.github.com/ then go the the top lefthand corner and click the down arrow next to the +. Select Clone, then select tolx/Vending-Machine-CS-M20

A pop-up box will appear, asking for where you want to download the project. Once downloaded, it should appear in your Github menu on the left side of the window. To open the project, navigate to the location you saved the project in, and open up the FinalProject folder, and double click the FinalProject.sln file (which will open your project in visual studio).

Once you have completed making your changes to the project, go back to the Github for Desktop client, make sure the Vending-Machine-CS-M20 project is select on the left, and click the Changes tab. It should show you the changes you have made - be sure to click Sync on the top right BEFORE you make a commit, to prevent overlapping commits. If all your changes looks correct, write a short summary of what you did, and a detailed description of all changes, then click Commit to master. If you are done editing for the time, click Sync again to Push your commit to the github website so everyone else can see you changes.

Please note, you can make multiple commits in one push, as that is normal for goot git editors. An example would be making changes to one section of code, then commit those changes, and make changes to another section of code, and commit those, then push both at the same time. That is better practice than pushing one large commit that makes changes to multiple sections, because you can revert individual commits.
